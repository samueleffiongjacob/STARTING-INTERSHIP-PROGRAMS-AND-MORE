### What I learned

I have done 3 frontend mentor projects in the past and at the time of submission, this the most difficult project I have taken on. this project tested my html, css and Javascript skills. and also
took me the longest time to complete. I also had to do it two times because the first one was behaving funny, so I took the knowledge gained from the first time to remake it. This was a fun project to take on. 
I wasn't able to get it to work as i would have loved to but i'm still happy with what i have done.

I leart form validation
Regular expression
CSS Position property
